# PasswordCheckerüîê
PasswordChecker is a python script which aims to help the user to test their password strength.<br>
According to a study carried out by <a href='https://nordpass.com/fr/most-common-passwords-list/'>NordVPN</a> researchers, the ten common passwords widely utilized in France are as follows: 
- 123456
- 123456789
- azerty
- 1234561
- azertyuiop
- avf2013
- loulou
- 000000
- password
- doudou
This clearly shows us there is a lot to do in users cybersecurity awareness.<br>
In regards to that, i decided to develop this script in order to sensitize the user, concerning the risks of using a weak password.<br>
**Note:** The mimimum length, and the entropy's appreciation are based on <a href='https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2021/10/anssi-guide-authentification_multifacteur_et_mots_de_passe.pdf'>ANSSI's password recommendations</a>.
