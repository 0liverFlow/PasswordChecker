 ## Purpose
PasswordChecker is a Python program that analyzes how strong a user's password is by performing several checks.
These checks include:
- Checking if the user's password has been exposed in HaveIBeenPwned's data breaches
- Verifying that the password meets a certain length requirement
- Calculating the percentage of characters in the password that belong to different character types (such as lowercase/uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols)
- Highlighting any characters that occur too frequently in the password
- Calculating the password's entropy, which is a measure of how difficult the password would be for an attacker to guess
- Generating a new, strong password for the user to use if desired."

This clearly shows us there is a lot to do in users cybersecurity awareness.<br>
In regards to that, i decided to develop this script in order to sensitize the user, concerning the risks of using a weak password.<br>
**Note:** The mimimum length, and the entropy's appreciation are based on <a href='https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2021/10/anssi-guide-authentification_multifacteur_et_mots_de_passe.pdf'>ANSSI's password recommendations</a>.
